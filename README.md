# Dart learning

2024-02-11

Today I figured out how the structure of a simple (or maybe not so simple) app looks from the inside. It contains a lot of little parts that go to a one bunch of dependencies. We talked a lot about OOP and the simplicity of Haskell in comparison with other programming languages' overwhelming syntax. We discussed null safety (nullable and non-nullable, adding ? or ! to indicate nullability or non-nullability, null-checking).

Today I started to read the DartBook. Currently I read the first chapter about built-in types in dart. I've read about number types (int, double), strings and methods of work with them, bool, lists and how to work with them, and now I'm reading about Records.

Today I've read the first chapter and wrote summary, using following questions. I still have questions about Final & Late, Dynamic & Object, that question about the most appropriate data type (seems like I've understood it now, don't need to ask anymore, 'll do it tomorrow morning on my own). I need to finish the question about null-safety.

Today I started to do tasks with strings. I want to go quickly through the tasks with lists, maps and sets and start the second chapter about operators, pattern matching and control structures.

Today I learned about pattern-matching and destructing. Destructing is a way to extract data from an object.
A pattern always tests against a value to determine if the value has the form you expect. In other words, you are checking if the value matches the pattern. When an object and pattern match, the pattern can then access the object's data and extract it in parts. In other words, the pattern destructures the object.

Today I started to read the second chapter, that is about functions, libraries and testing. The author starts the chapter with talking about abstractions in general and considering what it means. Then he goes talking about what every programming language consists of...

...and the he eventually goes to functions. He talks about what functions are by themselves, about how to declare them and how to use them, then he talks about declaring entering arguments of a function. There are the next types of arguments: positional; named(wrapped in {}); optional(wrapped in []) and combinations of these.

Then he talks about a call to a function through the variable, and then about a function itself like an argument of another function.

Further in the chapter he introduces a type alias (often called a typedef because it's declared with the keyword typedef), that is is a concise way to refer to a type.

Then starts the paragraph about the lambda functions and the arrow functions.

We talked about closures, and in case of this theme we discussed lambda functions and how they appeared, the levels of ierarchy, OOP and Functional Programming. It all started with a joke about the closure being an object for poor people and then it became a real topic.
