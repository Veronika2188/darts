# Dart learning

2024-02-11

Today I figured out how the structure of a simple (or maybe not so simple) app looks from the inside. It contains a lot of little parts that go to a one bunch of dependencies. We talked a lot about OOP and the simplicity of Haskell in comparison with other programming languages' overwhelming syntax. We discussed null safety (nullable and non-nullable, adding ? or ! to indicate nullability or non-nullability, null-checking).

Today I started to read the DartBook. Currently I read the first chapter about built-in types in dart. I've read about number types (int, double), strings and methods of work with them, bool, lists and how to work with them, and now I'm reading about Records.

Today I've read the first chapter and wrote summary, using following questions. I still have questions about Final & Late, Dynamic & Object, that question about the most appropriate data type (seems like I've understood it now, don't need to ask anymore, 'll do it tomorrow morning on my own). I need to finish the question about null-safety.

Today I started to do tasks with strings. I want to go quickly through the tasks with lists, maps and sets and start the second chapter about operators, pattern matching and control structures.

Today I learned about pattern-matching and destructing. Destructing is a way to extract data from an object.
A pattern always tests against a value to determine if the value has the form you expect. In other words, you are checking if the value matches the pattern. When an object and pattern match, the pattern can then access the object's data and extract it in parts. In other words, the pattern destructures the object.
